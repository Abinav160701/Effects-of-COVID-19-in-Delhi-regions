The project is done on the pollution dataset obtained from different stations across different cities over the course of 8 years from 2013-2020. We use the 2013-2019 data to train and validate our model and then use it to predict our final 2020 values. However, due to lockdown, we find that there is considerable variation in our actual 2020 values and our predictions. This is accounted for the effect of lockdown.

We first use various model(Random Forest and GBoost) and different methods(randomly choose validation set and use 2019 for validation) and (multivariate and univariate analysis) and (use all previous year data and use only past three years data). We then come up with 12 different models for each of our 7 pollutants and choose the best model-method combination for each pollutant to finally predict out 2020 values.

We then consider the rmse value we obtained when training the model into our 2020 predictions. This results in negating our model error and we'll approximately be left only with the lockdown effect.
